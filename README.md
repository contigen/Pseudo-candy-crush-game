# Pseudo Candy Crush Game

A candy crush like game, that features a group of boxes of different random colours, and you basically, drag 3 boxes of matching colours to win. The functionality to select 4 boxes might be added.

## Why?

The reason I created this project was to understand game logic and improve on code logic, generally speaking, and I'm just that curious.

## Contributing

Fork the repo, add to the code , make a Pull Request and that's it, here's two things you might be interested in contributing to, nice eh?

- Matched boxes don't get automatically removed from the board
- Functionality of selecting 4 boxes is not present
